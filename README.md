## RSS Reader in Titanium

Trying to learn more about Titanium and for that I needed a target to reach not just to play around with it. An RSS reader seems the best choice as for that I need to learn more elements.

##Learning Process

###1. Install Titanium and its iOS , Android and Web add-ons.

Pretty straight forward actually.

###2. Figure out how to run the project on my iPhone.

This took awhile. A whole problem with certificates, keys and authorizations in order to get my iPhone working with Titanium.

###3. Create a Hello World.

This was done faster than I thought. Creating a new project in Titanium gives you exactly that. Played around a little by deleting and adding code, but didn't learn that much.

###4. Start and actually learn Titanium.

Here is where I looked at tutorials. Some of the resources that I liked are linked below.

* [Building Native Mobile Applications](http://vimeopro.com/appcelerator/building-native-mobile-applications)
* [Jeff Batt YouTube Channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/jeffbatt01/videos)
* [Loot Tutorial YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/LootTutorial/videos)

###5. Learn about Window and Labels.

What I've seen is that there is no scrolling. Some sort of ```rgb position: absolute;``` enabled by default. Noticed that in Xcode also when working with it.

###6. Learn about Text Label and inserting an Image.

Too many elements on screen now, need to move on soon.

###7. Added scroll.

By inserting everything into a ScrollView.

###8. Find and modify code for a RSS Reader.

Resources I used for testing RSS feeds.

* [Code from School's Class](https://github.com/mide765/RSS/commit/4117e96335ba5a81d53c206c611057299103db42)
* [Titanium Demos](https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/blob/master/demos/KitchenSink/Resources/examples/rss.js)
* [Integrating Appcelerator's Titanium with SimpleAJAX.com](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6g-ela2S58)

The last link works, but not every time. I will stick with that, as it's enough for my needs. What it shows is just a plain text list of all the news, one text under another.

###9. (In development) Add header label and add hyperlinks to each news title.
